\section{Introduction to core design patterns}

\subsection{A little history}
Haskell was the first programming language to popularize the notion of
monad as a structuring technique for functional programming. There
were several key ideas that went into the $\Haskell$ packaging of the
idea. One was to treat the core elements that make up a monad more or
less \emph{directly} without appeal to category theory -- the branch
of mathematics where the notion originated. This is considerably
easier to do in a functional programming language because the ambient
language can be thought of as a category; thus, for the average
programmer there is no need to refer to categories, in general, but
only to the ``universe'' of programs that can be written in the
language at hand. Then, because Haskell already has a notion of
parametric polymorphism, a monad's most central piece of data is a
parametric type constructor, say $T$.

\paragraph{Haskell's monad API}
Given such a type constructor, you only need a pair of maps (one of
which is higher order). Thus, in $\Haskell$ a monad is presented in
terms of the following data

\begin{itemize}
  \item a parametric type constructor, \lstinline[language=Haskell]!T! a
  \item a \lstinline[language=Haskell]!return! map enjoying the
    signature \lstinline[language=Haskell]!return :: a -> T a!
  \item a \lstinline[language=Haskell]!bind! map enjoying the
    signature \lstinline[language=Haskell]!bind : T a -> (a -> T b) -> T b!
\end{itemize}

In $\Haskell$ these elements can be collected inside a
\lstinline[language=Haskell]!typeclass!. Resulting in a declaration of
the form

% TODO : add typeclass
\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b,language=Haskell,caption=monad typeclass]
  typeclass Monad T a where
   return :: a -> T a
   bind :: T a -> (a -> T b ) -> T b
\end{lstlisting}

Now, it's not enough to simply have this collection of pieces. The
pieces have to fit together in a certain way; that is, they are
subject to the following laws:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \lstinline[language=Haskell]!return (bind a f)! $\equiv$ \lstinline[language=Haskell]!f a! %[Left identity]
  \item \lstinline[language=Haskell]!bind m return! $\equiv$ \lstinline[language=Haskell]!m! %[Right identity]
  \item \lstinline[language=Haskell]!bind (bind m f) g! $\equiv$ \lstinline[language=Haskell]!bind m (\ x -> bind (f x) g)! %[Associativity]
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Do-notation}
One of the driving motivations for this particular formulation of the
concept is that it makes it very easy to host a little DSL inside the
language. The syntax and semantics of the DSL is simultaneously given
by the following procedure for de-sugaring, i.e. translating
expressions in the DSL back to core \texttt{Haskell}.

\break
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell,mathescape=true,frame=single,caption={do-notation de-sugaring},captionpos=b]
  do { x } $=$ x
 
  do { x ; <stmts> }
  $=$ bind x (\_ -> do { <stmts> })
 
  do { v <- x ; <stmts> }
  $=$ bind x (\v -> do { <stmts> }) 

  do { let <decls> ; <stmts> }
  $=$ let <decls> in do { <stmts> }
\end{lstlisting} 

The assignment-like operation extends to full pattern matching with

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell,mathescape=true]
  do { p <- x ; <stmts> }
  $=$ let f p = do { <stmts> }
              f _     = fail "..."
      in bind x f
\end{lstlisting}

On the face of it, the notation provides both a syntax and a semantics
reminiscent of the standard side-effecting operations of mainstream
imperative languages. In presence of polymorphism, however, these
instruments are much more powerful. These operations can be
\emph{systematically} ``overloaded'' (meaning the overloaded
definitions satisfy the laws above). This allows to systematically use
the notation for a wide variety of computations that all have some
underlying commonality. Typical examples include I/O, state
management, control flow (all three of which all bundle up in
parsing), and also container navigation and manipulation. It gets
better for many of the tools of mathematics that are regularly the
subject of computer programs such as probability distributions,
integration, etc., also have presentations as monads. Thus, innocent
examples like this one

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
  do { putStrLn "Enter a line of text:";
       x <- getLine;
       putStrLn ("you wrote: " ++ x) }
\end{lstlisting}

as might be found in some on-line tutorial on monads belie the potency
of this combination of ideas.

\paragraph{for-comprehensions}
Unlike $\Haskell$, $\Scala$ does not reify the notion of monad under a
\lstinline[language=Scala]!trait!, the language's equivalent of
$\Haskell$'s \lstinline[language=Haskell]!typeclass!. Instead the
systematic means of de-sugaring
\lstinline[language=Scala]!for!-notation and polymorphic
interpretations of \lstinline[language=Scala]!flatMap!, etc are the
effective definitions of the notion in $\Scala$.

The basic \texttt{Scala} construct looks like

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
  for( p <- e [; p <- e] [p = e] [if t] ) yield { e }
\end{lstlisting}

and the de-sugaring looks like

\break
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala,mathescape=true,frame=single,caption={for-comprehension de-sugaring},captionpos=b]
  for( x <- expr$_1$ ; y <- expr$_2$ ; <stmts> )
  yield expr$_3$
  $=$
  expr$_1$ flatMap(
             x => for( y <- expr$_2$; <stmts> ) yield expr$_3$
           )

  for( x <- expr$_1$ ; y = expr$_2$ ; <stmts> ) 
  yield expr$_3$
  $=$
  for( ( x, y ) <- for ( x <- expr$_1$ ) yield ( x, expr$_2$ );
       <stmts> )
  yield expr$_3$

  for( x <- expr$_1$ if pred ) yield expr$_2$ 
  $=$
  expr$_1$ filter ( x => pred ) map ( x => expr$_2$ )    
\end{lstlisting}

Again, general pattern matching is supported in assignment-like statements.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala,mathescape=true]
  for( p <- expr$_1$ ; <stmts> ) yield expr$_2$ 

  $=$

  expr$_1$ filter {
    case p => true
    case _ => false
  } flatMap {
    p => for( <stmts> ) yield expr$_2$
  }
\end{lstlisting}

This means, therefore, inside the appropriate code context (i.e., a
\lstinline[language=Haskell]!do!-block or a
\lstinline[language=Scala]!for!-comprehension, respectively) we have
the following correspondence

\begin{center}
%
%\fbox{ % \frame{ fail here..
\begin{minipage}{2.1764in}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell,mathescape=true]
  ptn <- expr
  return expr
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
%}
%
\begin{minipage}{2.1764in}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala,mathescape=true]
  ptn <- expr
  yield expr
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
%
\end{center}

with a kind of spiritual kinship between \lstinline[language=Haskell,mathescape=true]!expr$_1$ $<<$ expr$_2$! and \lstinline[language=Scala,mathescape=true]!expr$_1$ ; expr$_2$!.
